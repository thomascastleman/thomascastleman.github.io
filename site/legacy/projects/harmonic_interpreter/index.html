      <p>In an effort to create music visualizations that are sensitive to the qualities of the harmony being played, 
        I tried to algorithmically classify sets of notes based on their harmonic qualities.</p>
      <p>The above paper details my approach, which involves interpreting the notes with every possible root, 
        and then scoring each interpretation based on the presence or absence of certain intervals, the importance 
        of which is specified through parameters.</p>

      <p>I have already implemented a Processing sketch which takes MIDI input 
        from a keyboard and displays twelve interpretations, which can be 
        found <a href="https://github.com/thomascastleman/midi-harmony-interpreter" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        
        
      <p>This technology has potential to be used to design visualizations that respond to the 
        intricacies of the harmony being played.</p>
