      <h3 class="subtitle"><i>2018-19</i></h3>

      <p>For the 2019 production of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> at St. 
        Anne's-Belfield school, I worked together with Mariah Payne to 
        create a digital piece that would enhance the performance.</p>

      <p>We decided to build a digital rose animation that would change over
      the course of the show and augment key scenes with timed visual effects.</p>

      <p>For a visual demonstration of the rose, check out 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/ZjnsLT1vo_4" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>

      <p>The rose was created using 
        <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>. The actual
        shapes of the rose petals/stem were transferred into Processing by tracing 
        actual images with the mouse to get coordinates that could be turned 
        into primitive polygons.</p>
        
      <p>There is an unfortunate amount of hard-coded polygon coordinates in the 
        source, but this prompted later work on 
        <a href="/projects/lowpoly" target="_blank">automatic generation of low poly images</a>.</p>

      <p>The following features were implemented:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Fading of colors / shrinking of parts of the rose smoothly over
          the duration of the show.
        </li>
        <li>
          Falling petals, with particle system glitter.
        </li>
        <li>
          A dramatic shattering effect for when the Beast dies and the last 
          petal falls.
        </li>
        <li>
          A reconstruction effect from the shattered state, for when the Beast
          transforms into a human. Complete with a fountain of glitter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Emergency reset, in case an effect is triggered accidentally 
          at the wrong moment in the performance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>For the actual production, the rose sketch was projected onto a side wall
        of the theater, and operated by a crew member up in the catwalk. We simply
        put Processing on a school laptop and implemented key commands that allowed
        the operator to control the effects.

      <p>Unfortunately, the camera had trouble picking up a clear shot of the
        the rose, but it was quite crisp in person.
