      <h3 class="subtitle"><i>2018</i></h3>

      <p>As my friend <a href="https://github.com/johnnylindbergh" target="_blank">Johnny Lindbergh</a> completed research on the use of neural networks in
          machine learning for his senior capstone project, we decided to experiment 
          with building a simple neural network from the ground up--mostly to test our 
          understanding of the math taking place in algorithms such as gradient descent.</p>
  
      <p>The result of our labors is 
        <a href="https://github.com/thomascastleman/fancy-regression" target="_blank">this network,</a> 
        a digit classifier capable of recognizing handwritten digits (from the MNIST dataset) with 89.1% accuracy, written 
        from scratch.</p> 
        
        <p>This project deeply improved my understanding of both the C language 
        and the calculus used in backpropagation. While there are certainly many improvements / optimizations 
        that could be made to this network, it served its purpose of laying the foundations of my understanding 
        of machine learning methods.</p>

      <p>I also wrote a p5.js sketch (shown above) to take 
        handwritten input, pass it through the net, and display the classification output vector.
