<p>In August 2018, I deployed 
<a href="https://github.com/thomascastleman/StabOverflow" target="_blank">StabOverflow</a>, 
an online Q&amp;A forum for CS students at St. Anne's-Belfield (my high school).</p>

<p>Modeled after the widely-used 
Stack Overflow, StabOverflow allows students to ask questions, make comments, and respond 
with answers to CS-related problems. The idea was to facilitate interaction between members 
of the CS department across course / grade levels, and to construct, over time, a cumulative 
resource for all CS students to reference.</p>
