      <h3 class="subtitle"><i>2018-19</i></h3>

      <p>In late 2018, <a href="https://github.com/johnnylindbergh" target="_blank">Johnny</a> and I 
        started working on an audio processor that would harmonize 
        live vocals with the notes specified by a MIDI controller. I took 
        inspiration from the harmoniser built for Jacob 
        Collier, which was created at MIT by <a href="https://ben.ai/" target="_blank">Ben Bloomberg</a>.</p>

      <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%;">

        <span>A vocal sample visualized with a script we used to test our peak finding algorithm</span>
      </div>

      <p>Our harmoniser, the source for which can be found 
        <a href="https://github.com/Castleman-Lindbergh/harmoniser" target="_blank">here</a>, 
        interfaces with a microphone and MIDI keyboard. It works as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>The pitch (if any) of the input signal from the mic (the vocal track) is detected</li>
          <li>Several copies of this signal are made, one for each note coming through
            the MIDI keyboard</li>
          <li>These signals are each pitch-shifted (using a technique called 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSOLA" target="_blank">Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add</a>) to the corresponding 
            frequency of those MIDI notes</li>
          <li>All the signals are then averaged back 
            together into one, which is played back.</li>
        </ol>
  
      <p>The result is a really interesting layered vocal track that matches the notes 
        held on the MIDI keyboard.</p>

      <p>We even incorporated this harmoniser into a tune. Listen 
        below (as of now, unnamed, featuring Matt Wyatt, David Argo, & Thomas Castleman).</p>
