<p>In November of 2018, I was involved in a 3-week long course focused on technology, 
music, and visual art, during which I created this software, which translates 
input from a MIDI instrument into a visual display of colors 
and shapes.</p>

<p>The project took shape over several days and I documented my progress 
through video clips which I have pieced together in the above compilation. In the final clip, 
I play Debussy's <i>Clair de Lune</i> visualized with one of my favorite configurations.</p>
